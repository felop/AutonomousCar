I built this car for the [IronCar](https://twitter.com/ironcarfrance) race, where all cars are driven by artificial intelligence. It's the result of several weeks of tweaking and programming.

## ‚öôÔ∏è hardware : 
* RaspberryPi 3b+
* RC car (T2M Pirate Shooter)
* PiCamera (wide angle)
* RaspberryPi PWM shield
* some voltage regulators
* wifi dongle
* 2x batteries
* relay module as an emergency stop

## üíø software :
The car's on-board computer is in charge of processing the images in order to predict the wheels' orientation to correct the car's trajectory. 
This analysis is done by a combination of convolutional and sequential neural networks. These networks predict a direction according to the input image, processed by algorithms in charge of transforming the camera feed into data adapted for the network.

The other on-board computer (it was an Arduino at first but it has been replaced by a PWM shield) is in charge of retrieving the predictions of the network and transmitting them to the different motors.

## üéõ new upgrades :
To improve stability and thus image quality, I 3D printed two mounts to hold the plexiglass base.
